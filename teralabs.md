Welcome to teralabs: a place where you can find code that'll crash your computer, or occasionnaly(very rarely) work.

## 🔬 Ongoing Experiments <a id="ongoing"></a>

- **[SnarkOS](/snarkos/)** — A terminal based AI assistant. Answers your questions and roasts your life choices.
- **[PowerScan](/powerscan/)** — A “totally harmless” network scanner that might alert your ISP.
- **[OuroboAI](/ouroboai/)** — Self-improving AI experiments. Part genius, part curse.

## ☠️ Prototype Pile <a id="pile"></a>

Stuff so cursed, I'm nor showing the code for these.

- **TTS from Arduino** — Streams audio from an arduino to a GPU-powered STT-TTS engine. It only screams sometimes. Supposed to end up looking like TARS...
- **Wifi Signal Matrix Visualizer** — Reads your soul through WiFi RSSI and draws it on the arduino r4 wifi's matrix. Way to embarrased to share *that* code.

## 🛠️ Coming Soon (Or Never) <a id="soon"></a>

- Malware that just opens Minesweeper on the target
- Turing Machine that codes AI in python
- Much more(Yeah, I'm sorry. I'm still active)
