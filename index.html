# Wassup, I’m Teralix

15 y/o dev. Linux gremlin. Python punk.  
Terminal-born sarcasm engine with a keyboard problem.

Building weird, cursed tools no one asked for,  
but everyone will **eventually** fear.

## ⚔️ Featured Projects

Here’s what I’m making instead of touching grass:

- 🤖 [SnarkOS](/snarkos/) — sarcastic neural assistant with just enough functionality to be dangerous
- 📡 [PowerScan](/powerscan/) — network scanner built for mischief and misconfiguration
- 🧬 [OuroboroAI](/powerscan/) — AI that eats its own code and improves(read "demolishes") it
