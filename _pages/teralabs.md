> **Disclaimer:** Everything here is experimental, best enjoyed on a non-essential device. Or not at all.

## Ongoing Experiments <a id="ongoing"></a>

- **[SnarkOS](https://github.com/Teralix42?tab=repositories)** — A terminal based AI assistant. Answers your questions(rarely) while roasting you(always).
- **[PowerScan](https://github.com/Teralix42?tab=repositories)** — A network scanner that occasionnaly orders a pizza through it.
- **[OuroboAI](https://github.com/Teralix42?tab=repositories)** — Self-improving AI sandbox. The only thing left is to make an AI.
- **[This website](https://github.com/Teralix42/Teralix42.github.io)** — Yeah, the one you're regretting ever having found.

## Other "projects" <a id="other"></a>

Stuff the code of is to ugly to share.

- **Arduino TARS** — Streams audio from an arduino to a GPU-powered STT-TTS engine. Answers 10 to 20 minutes after you ask your question.
- **Wifi Signal Matrix Visualizer** — Reads WiFi RSSI and draws it on the arduino r4 wifi's matrix. Somehow ended up 400 lines long.
- **Binary clock** — Displays time in binary on arduino r4 led matrix, overall just looks horrible.
- **Neural Automata** — A cellular automata made of neural nets, written in glsl. 100+ hours of error messages.

## Coming Soon (Or Never) <a id="soon"></a>

- SCP time loop game(no comments)
- Turing Machine web simulator
- Discord quote bot('cause why not)
- Much more. Yep, I'm sorry. I'm still active
