## Ongoing Experiments <a id="ongoing"></a>

- **[SnarkOS](https://github.com/Teralix42?tab=repositories)** — A terminal based AI assistant. Answers your questions(rarely) while roasting you(always).
- **[PowerScan](https://github.com/Teralix42?tab=repositories)** — A “totally harmless” network scanner that may or may not destroy it in the process.
- **[OuroboAI](https://github.com/Teralix42?tab=repositories)** — Self-improving AI sandbox. The only thing left is to make an AI.
- **[This website](https://github.com/Teralix42/Teralix42.github.io)** — Yeah, the one you're regretting ever having found.

## Prototype Pile <a id="pile"></a>

Stuff I'm to ashamed to dhare the code for.

- **Arduino TARS** — Streams audio from an arduino to a GPU-powered STT-TTS engine. It only screams sometimes.
- **Wifi Signal Matrix Visualizer** — Reads WiFi RSSI and draws it on the arduino r4 wifi's matrix. Managed to make that code 200 lines long.

## Coming Soon (Or Never) <a id="soon"></a>

- Malware that just opens Minesweeper on the target
- Turing Machine that codes AIs in python
- Discord quote bot('cause why not)
- Much more(Yeah, I'm sorry. I'm still active)
