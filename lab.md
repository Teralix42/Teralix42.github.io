> “If it works, it’s production. If it doesn’t, it’s experimental.” — me, justifying everything on this page

Welcome to da Lab: a dark corner of the internet where you can find code that *will* crash your computer, and occasionnaly something that works.

## 🔬 Ongoing Experiments

- **[SnarkOS](/snarkos/)** — Sarcastic neural assistant. Answers your questions and roasts your life choices.
- **[PowerScan](/powerscan/)** — A “totally harmless” network scanner that might alert your ISP.
- **[OuroboroAI](/powerscan/)** — Self-mangling AI experiments. Part genius, part curse.

## ☠️ Prototype Pile

Stuff so cursed, I didn’t even version-control it properly.

- **TTS from Arduino** — Stream audio from a microcontroller to a GPU-powered STT-TTS engine. It only screams sometimes. Supposed to end up looking like TARS...
- **Wifi Signal Matrix Visualizer** — Reads your soul through WiFi RSSI and draws it in LED chaos. Way to embarrased to share *that* code.

## 🛠️ Coming Soon (Or Never)

- AI that controls a fan based on sarcasm levels
- Malware that just opens Minesweeper on the target
- Turing Machine that writes bad poetry
