  <h1>Well. This is awkward.</h1>
  <p>You're clearly lost. Either that, or the page moved. Or you're just bad at typing.</p>

  <h2>But hey, don’t go yet:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>🧠 <a href="/">Return to the homepage</a> — Where the sarcasm started</li>
    <li>🧬 <a href="/teralabs">Check out my projects</a> — Possibly functional, mostly chaos</li>
    <li>🐙 <a href="https://github.com/Teralix42">GitHub</a> — Where spaghetti gets pushed</li>
  </ul>
  <p>You’re still part of the empire, broken link or not.</p>
